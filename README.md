A sorting algorithm is an algorithm made up of a series of instructions that takes an array as input, performs specified operations on the array, sometimes called a list, and outputs a sorted array. Sorting algorithms are often taught early in computer science classes as they provide a straightforward way to introduce other key computer science topics like Big-O notation, divide-and-conquer methods, and data structures such as binary trees, and heaps. There are many factors to consider when choosing a sorting algorithm to use.

In other words, a sorted array is an array that is in a particular order. For example, [a,b,c,d][a,b,c,d] is sorted alphabetically, [1,2,3,4,5][1,2,3,4,5] is a list of integers sorted in increasing order, and [5,4,3,2,1][5,4,3,2,1] is a list of integers sorted in decreasing order.

A sorting algorithm takes an array as input and outputs a permutation of that array that is sorted.

There are two broad types of sorting algorithms:-
integer sorts
comparison sorts.
